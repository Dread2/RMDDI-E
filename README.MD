# CTS RMDDI-E™ Software

CTS RMDDI-E™ (Realtek Modern Device Driver Initiative: Ethernet) is an open-source stack, composed primarily of Linux kernel driver software, designed for high-performance Ethernet device support. RMDDI-E™ consists of a collection of drivers, patches, and development tools, written in C and Rust, that enable Realtek Ethernet devices including legacy, rare, and undocumented variants to perform optimally on modern Linux systems.

With RMDDI-E™, you can customize your Ethernet driver support to meet your specific needs. You can develop, collaborate, test, and deploy networking applications in a free, open-source, integrated, and maintainable software ecosystem. RMDDI-E™ is particularly well-suited for high-performance computing, embedded Linux, and networking applications.

RMDDI-E™ is powered by CTS’s development framework, providing a modular, maintainable, and future-proof driver architecture. This framework allows developers to create portable drivers that support a range of Realtek Ethernet devices, from common consumer NICs to legacy or undocumented variants.

RMDDI-E™ supports Linux kernel programming and includes all necessary drivers, patches, and utilities to ensure reliable operation. It contributes improvements to in-tree kernel drivers, providing enhanced performance, quality, and stability while maintaining compatibility with ongoing Linux kernel development.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Kernel development and testing for RMDDI-E™ is performed on the latest Gentoo release `gentoo-sources` kernel, ensuring compatibility with modern kernel features and long-term maintainability.
